abstract="Recently, using graph theory, we developed procedures for the construction of {V}enn diagrams. Utilizing these procedures with some new methods introduced here, we determine the number of simple, reducible spherical {V}enn diagrams of five sets. In so doing, we obtain examples of {V}enn diagrams which yield answers to several problems and conjectures of Gr{\"u}nbaum. Among others, we construct a simple, reducible {V}enn diagram with five congruent ellipses. We show that this diagram is unique on the sphere and produces two different plane diagrams. This corrects some erroneous statements that started with John {V}enn more than a century ago in 1880 and have been repeated frequently by others ever since.",

We report computational study results on the practical performance of DPBF algorithm, which show that the size of instances can be solved by the algorithm mainly depends on the branchwidth of the instances, coinciding with the theoretical analysis. For graphs with small or moderate branchwidth, the CDS problem instances with size up to a few thousands edges can be solved in a practical time and memory space.",

abstract="We present a general framework for designing fast subexponential exact and parameterized algorithms on planar graphs. Our approach is based on geometric properties of planar branch decompositions obtained by Seymour and Thomas, combined with refined techniques of dynamic programming on planar graphs based on properties of non-crossing partitions. To exemplify our approach we show how to obtain an                                                                            {\$}O(2^{\{}6.903{\backslash}sqrt{\{}n{\}}{\}}){\$}                 time algorithm solving weighted Hamiltonian Cycle on an n-vertex planar graph.

Our approach can be used to design parameterized algorithms as well. For example, we give an algorithm that for a given k decides if a planar graph on n vertices has a cycle of length at least k in time                                                                           {\$}O(2^{\{}13.6{\backslash}sqrt{\{}k{\}}{\}}n+n^{\{}3{\}}){\$}                .",
